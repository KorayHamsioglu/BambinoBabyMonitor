# BambinoBabyMonitor

Bambino Baby Monitor is an advanced and secure baby monitoring solution designed specifically for Android devices. With its real-time video and audio streaming capabilities, Bambino Baby Monitor provides parents with a comprehensive and reliable way to keep an eye on their little ones. The application leverages the power of TCP-based RTMP (Real-Time Messaging Protocol) to deliver seamless and uninterrupted video and audio broadcasting from the baby's device to the parent's device.

In addition to the main broadcasting function, Bambino Baby Monitor comes with a range of useful features to enhance the user experience. For example, the application alerts parents via push notifications when the baby's voice exceeds the ambient noise level. It also allows parents to remotely play music from the baby's device and adjust the volume as needed. The power-saving mode (audio only) is another convenient feature that conserves energy, while the ability to monitor the battery level of the baby's device from the parent's device provides peace of mind.

Security is a key consideration in the design of Bambino Baby Monitor, and the application uses Firebase Authentication for user authentication and verification. User credentials are securely stored in the Firestore Database, ensuring that only authorized users can access the application and the broadcast data.
